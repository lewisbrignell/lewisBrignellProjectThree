## What is it?

It's a lorem ipsum generator! Tired of remebering you can't read Latin? How about nonsensically long and unreasonable beverage orders instead?

## What's it made with?

Just HTML5, Sass and Javascript (ES6).

## How does it work?

Choose your size of ipsum text - grande is default - and hit the 'Make my Ipsum!' button. Don't like the result? Just click it again!
